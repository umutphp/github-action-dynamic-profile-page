# Dynamic Profile Page On GitHub

A GitHub action to push updates to your special profile repo.

### Why?

GitHub announced a special repository (github_username/github_username) so that its README.md file will appear on your profile page. People liked it a lot and started using some static pages with fancy texts and images. This GitHub action helps you to add a section that is updated dynamically when you commit a repository that uses this action. A line per repository is added to the section and the lines are ordered from the newest to the oldest. You can see a sample execution in [my profile page](https://github.com/umutphp).

## Usage

You can add this action to any repository other than profile repository (special repository). This action will add a line for every repository (that the action is activated) to the README file of the special repository.

Follow the steps;
- Create your special repository if not exists.
- Add `<!-- START gadpp -->` add the end of the README.md file of the special repo.
- Create a personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and set the `repo` permission.
- Add the access token created in previous step to the repository (that uses this action) as a secret with name `API_TOKEN_GITHUB`.
- Create the YML file for the action under `.github/workflows` of the repository (the one which is not the special repository). You can use the sample given below. Please update `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_USED_ON_GITHUB` values.
- Please do not forget to add checkout step before GADPP step in your pipeline.
